# ConnectFour

## Description

This program allows you to play Connect Four with a partner. The user specifies the dimensions of the board, then the board is printed and each player takes turns choosing a column to place their token. After each turn the program checks to see if a player as gotten four token in a row. The players take turns until each empty space on the board is filled. If neither player wins, the game ends in a draw.
